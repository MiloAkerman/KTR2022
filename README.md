# (Kick The Robot) Keep The Rats 2022

Battlecode 22 was not only my first year in Battlecode, but my first programming competition as a whole. Therefore, the code you will find in this repo will not be exemplary by any means. However, I did my best to ensure the code is neatly structured and easy to read. If you find any issues, please contact me at `Meelo#6036` on the Battlecode Discord server. 

*Post-mortem coming SON (sometime or never)*

- `zips`: all of the zips submitted. Note that files with no prefix go up until orbitalstrike and the osv prefix goes from os up until icbm.
  - `itsbeenagoodrunfolks.zip`: final bot submitted.
- `src`: the source code for the final version of each iteration.
  - `movetherobot`: the first bot. It moves, I think.
  - `testtherobot`: doesn't work. Doesn't test, either. I don't know why I made it, but it's there.
  - `burntherobot`: a failed and way too early implementation of a sage bot focused on fury. It did not work.
  - `kicktherobot`: the first working bot. (no strategy other than rushing soldiers)
  - `punttherobot`: a more refined version of kicktherobot. Still soldier rush, but more effective.
  - `orbitalstriketherobot`: I might have skipped a few names. First implementation of sages.
  - `icbmtherobot`: after much debate on whether icbms are more powerful than orbital stikes, the final version came about.
